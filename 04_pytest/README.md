# pytest

[pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) is a framework that makes it easy to write small tests, yet scales to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries.

## Installation

`pytest` is not part of the standard library so you will need to install it. It is available on PyPI and Anaconda Cloud via the conda-forge channel.

* pytest will run all files of the form test_*.py or *_test.py in the current directory and its subdirectories.
* detailed info on failing assert statements (no need to remember self.assert* names)
