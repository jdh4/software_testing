# Software Testing for Computational Researchers

This workshop is designed for anyone doing computational research that writes software toward a software tool or for data analysis. It is not designed


## It is easy to make subtle mistake:

```c++
if (x = y) {
  // do work
}
```

```python
a = 1
b = 2
a / b  # equals 0 in Python 2
a / b  # equals 0.5 in Python 3
```
